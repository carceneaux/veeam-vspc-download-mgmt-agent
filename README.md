# veeam-vspc-download-mgmt-agent

The script in this project serves as a workaround for automating the download of the VSPC (Veeam Service Provider Console) Management Agent installation files for Windows, Linux, & MacOS operating systems.

The expectation is that this script can be installed on a single server and be used to download the VSPC Mgmt Agent install file saving it to a _shared location_. Then, the files can be leveraged by custom automation when performing unattended installs.
